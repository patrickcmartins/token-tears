# token-tears

> where linux users go to heal after whipping LLMs into submission

---

this is where I dump the things that broke my brain  
then got fixed after 47 failed prompts to an AI that definitely hallucinated the solution

come join if you're:
- ✅ **an experienced coder** who still googles "how to git commit"  
- ✅ **a vibe coder** who `chmod 777` and prays  
- ✅ **a low coder** surviving Power Apps drag-and-drop hell  
- ✅ **a no coder** who just yelled at a terminal until it worked

no gatekeeping. just scars, solutions, and the sacred art of  
*asking an AI the same question 5 different ways until it caves*
