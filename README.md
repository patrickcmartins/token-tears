# token-tears

> where linux users go to heal after whipping LLMs into submission

---

this is where i dump the things that broke my brain  
then got fixed after 47 failed prompts to an AI that definitely hallucinated the solution

come join if you:
- ✅ **experience coders** who still google "how to git commit"
- ✅ **vibe coders** who `chmod 777` and pray
- ✅ **low coders** surviving Power Apps drag-and-drop hell
- ✅ **no coders** who just yelled at a terminal until it worked

no gatekeeping. just scars, solutions, and the sacred art of  
*asking an AI the same question 5 different ways until it caves*

`git clone token-tears.git`
